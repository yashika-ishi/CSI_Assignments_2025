It spans across nine countries, with the majority of it located in Brazil. The Amazon is incredibly biodiverse, home to an estimated 10% of the world's known species. It plays a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns due to its vast carbon absorption capacity, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth.\" Deforestation is a major threat to the Amazon, driven by cattle ranching, agriculture, and logging.

It plays a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns due to its vast carbon absorption capacity, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth.\" Deforestation is a major threat to the Amazon, driven by cattle ranching, agriculture, and logging. Protecting the Amazon is vital for climate stability and biodiversity preservation.\n",

In addition our analysis shows both extreme rainfall events and devastating effects on human populations including drought and disease growth. However if they do happen over time, such severe impacts can occur quickly. We believe this would help us better understand how long these catastrophic consequences have been going on.\n",
